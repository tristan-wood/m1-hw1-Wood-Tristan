My name is Tristan Wood. I am currently located in Tallahassee, Florida. I currently work as a journalist with the online digital state news outlet Florida Politics. I graduated from the University of Florida with a degree in journalism last Fall, and am now pursuing my Master's in Political Communication.
## Past Coding Experience ##
I think I may have played a hacker in a video game once. All jokes aside, this is the first time I have ever done anything remotely related to coding.
